12) false
Queen Victoria is the oldest and therefore descendant of no one

13) false
Was told by Professor Issac to implement age test by lifespan.
Prince Henry/Prince William have no death date in Royal.pl, 
so assumption that no death date = still living
therefore, Prince William is older than Prince Henry

------------------------
16)I really like that in Prolog answers can be solved by breaking
them down into smaller ones, such as family relations in this lab!
It's very easy to problem solve

17)The syntax is strange, but it honestly isnt bad at all. I like 
Prolog.

18)I really enjoyed this lab. Prolog was fun to use. I liked the royal
family data to play with, but disliked that i didnt have a reference
sheet of exact family relations ie: who is who's aunt/cousin/uncle etc.

19) 8 hours

20) I will def use prolog again when i have to manipulate data to 
find relationships between things. Maybe word processing to find
which words come after one another and attempt to have a program 
understand sentences.
